This is the work done on the required points on the World Bank's Climate Change data analysis.


In this repository there are two folders, the first one "data" stores the outputs and databases needed to run the rest of the files. The second folder "scripts" contains the scripts that perform all the calculations and data downloads. Additionally, this folder contains the file "Climate_Change_Fabian_Fuentes.Rmd" which contains the proposed analysis, using the rest of the files.
